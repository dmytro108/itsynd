### Deploy and scale an application using Docker ans AWS

For this task, you're going to be part of the deployment team of a tech company. Our client is a
start-up that wants to deploy a simple web application and ensure its availability to
accommodate variable traffic volumes. You're asked to:
1. Use Docker to run a simple web application on AWS utilizing:
- EC2 Auto-scaling group
- ECS Fargate
2. Direct incoming traffic to the application through a load balancer.
3. Use a load testing tool to simulate high traffic load on the endpoint, triggering resource
scaling and observing the process.
4. In conclusion, prepare a report detailing the pros and cons of each deployment method in
terms of ease of setup, cost, and scalability.
