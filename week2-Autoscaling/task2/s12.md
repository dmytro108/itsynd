## Deployment examples - Immutable Infrastructure

**Immutable Infrastructure Scenario: Cloud-Native Microservices**

*   **Tools Used:** Git for version control, Jenkins for CI/CD, Packer for creating machine images, Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for container orchestration.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Developers commit code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).
    2.  Jenkins triggers the build process, including creating a new Docker container image and using HashiCorp Packer to build a custom machine image.
    3.  Terraform provisions a fresh set of infrastructure resources based on the desired state defined in code, using the custom machine image created by Packer.
    4.  Kubernetes deploys the new containerized application and scales it as needed.
    5.  The previous infrastructure is terminated, ensuring that only the latest version is in production.
    6.  Continuous monitoring and automated scaling maintain optimal performance.

**Key Differences:**

*   In the mutable approach, updates are applied directly to existing servers, while the immutable approach replaces the entire infrastructure with new instances.
*   Immutable infrastructure leverages HashiCorp Packer for creating machine images, enhancing reproducibility and consistency.
*   Terraform is used for defining and provisioning infrastructure as code, and Docker containers ensure consistent application packaging."
