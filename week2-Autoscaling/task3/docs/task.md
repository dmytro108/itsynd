### Speed up application with CDN

The client is not satisfied with the application speed. He asked us to conduct a review and
provide suggestions for optimizing the application. Your tech lead researched and found that we need to set up a CDN to speed up the project.
You need:
- Connect AWS CloudFront before the load balancer
- Set up caching of dynamic and static content, except for /monitor and /tools locations
- Use the load testing tool to test your application through the CDN.
