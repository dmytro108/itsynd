#### Deployment app container to EC2
In this solution, I deploy containers with the test application on EC2 instances in an autoscaling group. A network balancer is used to balance requests. I didn't use the application balancer because of the test application is a monolith and there is no way to effectively distribute the load along different routes. I decided that using an application balancer would not provide any benefit. The design also includes a bastion host for secure access to instances running containers.
Automatic scaling out/in of the group occurs in stages when four CloudWatch alarms are triggered - the average CPU utilization of the group reaches 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%.
Alarms are configured with a minimum response period - one threshold value per 1 minute. To do this, I had to create my own dynamic policies in the autoscaling group and also to enable detailed CloudWatch monitoring in the EC2 instance launch template.
