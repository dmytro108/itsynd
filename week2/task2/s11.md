## Slide 13: Deployment examples - Mutable Infrastructure
 _Visual Media:_ Icons representing practical scenarios.

_Script:_ "Now, let's delve into practical use cases and explore the differences in deployment pipelines for mutable and immutable approaches.

**Mutable Infrastructure Scenario: E-Commerce Platform**

*   **Tools Used:** Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, Ansible for configuration management.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Developers commit code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).
    2.  Jenkins triggers the build process and runs tests.
    3.  If tests pass, Ansible is used to apply configuration changes to the existing servers.
    4.  Deployment is completed, and the updated application is live.
    5.  Regular monitoring and patch management ensure ongoing stability.
