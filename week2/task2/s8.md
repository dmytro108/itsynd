## Comparative Metrics
When evaluating the performance of both mutable and immutable infrastructure, it's crucial to consider various comparative metrics which provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

*   **Deployment Time:** How quickly can changes be deployed in each approach?
*   **Resource Utilization:** How efficiently are resources utilized, and how does it compare between the two?
*   **Error Rates:** What are the error rates, and how do they differ?
*   **Scalability:** How well does each approach handle increased workloads?
